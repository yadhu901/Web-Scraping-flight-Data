# Web-Scraping-flight-Data

the Python code Scrapes data from https://www.flysfo.com/flight-info/flight-status
to get information regarding gates, flights and destinations

After creating the data, I have consumed it in Tableau to build a 1 page Dashboard listing some important KPIs for Airports/Airlines.
